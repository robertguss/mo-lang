# VeraBench

[![VeraBench: benchmarks for code the machines write](assets/vera-bench-social-preview.png)](https://veralang.dev)

[![CI](https://github.com/aallan/vera-bench/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aallan/vera-bench/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/aallan/vera-bench/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/aallan/vera-bench)

A benchmark for evaluating LLM code generation in [Vera](https://github.com/aallan/vera), a programming language designed for large language models (LLMs) to write.

## Results

Six of the nine models solve every problem in Vera, a language absent from
every training set. Across the field Vera averages 98.7%, ahead of Python's
96.7% and a point behind TypeScript's 99.7%. Nine models, three providers, all
60 problems across five difficulty tiers, against [Vera
v0.1.8](https://github.com/aallan/vera/releases/tag/v0.1.8).

### Vera against Python and TypeScript

![Vera minus Python and TypeScript, percentage points, per model](assets/fig-delta.png)

Against Python, Vera wins for six of the nine models by three to five points,
draws one and loses two. Against TypeScript it wins one, draws five and loses
three.

However this says more [about the benchmark](#the-benchmark-is-saturating)
itself than it does about Vera. TypeScript scores 100% for eight of the nine
models and never drops below 97%, so there is no headroom left. Here the
benchmark is measuring the models rather than the languages.

### Static typing is the variable

The difference between the Python and TypeScript results is probably not
random. Python is dynamically typed, so a type error surfaces when the code
runs; TypeScript is statically typed and rejects the same error before anything
runs. Vera sits with TypeScript and goes further, making `requires`, `ensures`
and `effects` mandatory on every function and replacing variable names with
typed slot references.

Sort the three by how much they constrain the model rather than by how much of
them it has read, and the ordering stops looking accidental: the two that
constrain it finish ahead of the one that doesn't.

The failure modes agree. Python's failures land as runtime wrong answers rather
than compile rejections, thirteen against three; TypeScript has one of each. A
loose language cannot reject a bad program up front, so the mistake survives to
execution and is recorded as a wrong answer.

TypeScript earns its result through its presence in every training set. Vera
earns very nearly the same result without that, from a single skill file in
context. The [zero-training-data
comparison](#all-three-zero-training-data-languages) illustrates this, holding
exposure at zero for all three languages and varying only the design: Vera
98.2%, AILANG 96.8%, Aver 92.4%, with Vera also ahead of Python on the same
five models. The most constrained language scores highest.

> There is a caveat on the size of the Python gap. Some of it may be ours (See [#121](https://github.com/aallan/vera-bench/issues/121)). TypeScript is structurally typed, so the grader's test value is accepted even where the model's type never declared the field, and Python's constructor raises instead. On two problems the identical modelling choice scored solved in TypeScript and not solved in Python.

### Full results

Each model runs the Vera problems twice, because there are two questions worth
asking.

The first (Vera) hands the model a full specification, meaning the type
signature and its contracts, and asks only for the body. That tests whether it
can write Vera.

The second (Vera NL) gives it the problem in English and nothing more, so it
infers the types, writes the contracts, and then writes code satisfying them.
That tests whether it understands Vera well enough to specify a problem in it.
Those are the first two columns; on the command line, the default and `--mode
spec-from-nl`.

| Model | Vera | Vera NL | Python | TypeScript |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Fable 5 | **100%** | 97% | 97% | 97% |
| GPT-5.6 Sol (pro) | **100%** | 90% | 95% | **100%** |
| Claude Opus 5 | **100%** | 95% | 95% | **100%** |
| Claude Opus 4.8 | 93% | 93% | 98% | **100%** |
| GPT-5.6 Sol | 98% | 92% | 95% | **100%** |
| Kimi K3 | **100%** | 92% | **100%** | **100%** |
| Claude Sonnet 5 | 97% | 87% | 98% | **100%** |
| GPT-5.6 Terra | **100%** | 92% | 95% | **100%** |
| Kimi K2.6 | **100%** | 93% | 97% | **100%** |

Aver and AILANG, the other two zero-training-data languages, were run for a
five-model subset.

The Vera NL column is the one with real spread. It runs from 87% to 97% while
the other three bunch between 93% and 100%, and no model closes the gap.
Unsurprisingly writing code against a specification someone else wrote is
easier than deciding what the specification should say, and that distance is
the only measurement here with room left to move.

The charts below are described in [assets/README.md](assets/README.md) along
with the command to regenerate them.

### Across model generations

![Three Claude flagships across four languages](assets/fig-generation.png)

Three consecutive Claude flagships, oldest to newest. Claude Opus 4 solved
fewer problems in Vera than in Python; Claude Opus 5 reverses that. Across the
line Vera gains 11 points and Vera NL 14, while Python gains 1 and TypeScript
does not move.

Only the last step is controlled. Claude Opus 4 was measured against an older
compiler, an older standard library, an older skills file and a smaller set of
graded problems, so that step measures the ecosystem improving alongside the
model, in unknown proportion. Claude Opus 4.8 and Claude Opus 5 were measured
identically and move the same way. So these results are suggestive rather than
conclusive.

### Reasoning mode

![GPT-5.6 Sol at two reasoning modes, across four languages](assets/fig-reasoning.png)

One model, two reasoning modes, the same problems. Here, how the model reasons
is the only variable.

The model is GPT-5.6 Sol. OpenAI's Responses API takes a `reasoning.mode`
parameter, and the two runs set it to `standard` and to `pro`; nothing else
differs.

`reasoning.mode` is a separate axis from `reasoning.effort`. Mode picks which
execution path the model takes, standard or pro. Effort controls how much
reasoning it does once it is on that path. This chart varies mode and leaves
effort at its default, so what it measures is the more thorough execution path
rather than simply a longer think on the same one.

Vera gains two points on the pro path, Vera NL loses two, and Python and
TypeScript do not move. Whatever stops these models on the last one or two
problems is not something the pro path fixes. That matters mainly because the
pro entry is the most expensive run in the sweep, and Vera's standing does not
depend on it. Given the narrow margins the results here are effectively null.

### Refusals

![Refusals by model and language](assets/fig-refusal.png)

There were four refusals across the whole run, every one of them in Python or
TypeScript. There were no refusals for Vera, Aver or AILANG. The problems were
unremarkable, along the lines of dividing two numbers and guarding against a
zero divisor, and in each case the same model went on to solve the same problem
in four or five other languages.

All four came from Claude Fable 5 and Claude Opus 5, the two models in the
benchmark that ship cybersecurity classifiers. These refusals are therefore
likely to be false positives from those guardrails rather than anything to do
with the problems themselves.

### What the contracts cannot see

![The six programs that cleared vera check and still failed](assets/fig-coverage.png)

One Vera program out of the 540 written by the models never compiled. Of the
remaining 539 programs, six compiled, satisfied their contracts, but were still
wrong. That is 1.1%.

One of the six was caught at runtime by its own postcondition, so the contract
did its job a step later than intended. One never terminated, having satisfied
a `decreases` clause the checker accepted. The other four ran to completion,
kept every promise they made, but still returned the wrong answer. Contracts
bound what a program may do; they do not say everything it must do.

Two of those four are the same problem, failed by two different models, and its
contracts are `requires(true)` and `ensures(true)`. It's likely that this
result says more about a weak problem specification in the benchmark than about
Vera, or about the model that wrote the program.

Nothing went wrong in the other direction. No program that ran correctly was
refused, and no program the gate refused ran correctly.

### The benchmark is saturating

![Every model against every language, one dot each, on a zoomed axis](assets/fig-saturation.png)

Every model against every language, one dot each. The whole field sits between
87% and 100%, and all nine models reach 100% in at least one language. With 60
graded problems a single problem moves a score by 1.7 percentage points, so
most of the gaps we've been discussing above are only one or two problems wide.

This is the most serious limitation to the current benchmark. TypeScript scores
100% for eight of the nine models and Vera for six, so at the top of the range
the problems are no longer asking anything. While the benchmark can still tell
you that a language unfamiliar to the model performs as well as languages it is
familiar with, which is the question it was built to answer, it can no longer
differentiate between the languages.

The benchmark is saturated, and the next version needs more and harder
problems. If we extend the benchmark with harder problems we might see the
current trend extend further, with models writing poorer TypeScript for the
harder problems, while still being able to perform well when writing Vera, a
language that constrains their choices more severely.

### A controlled comparison

![Vera against Aver, both zero-training-data languages, five models](assets/fig-vera-vs-aver.png)

Comparing Vera to Python confounds two variables: the languages differ in
design, and they differ enormously when it comes to training data. Python is
common in the training data of all the models, and Vera is entirely absent.

[Aver](https://github.com/jasisz/aver) is another language designed for models
to write. Like Vera it is statically typed, absent from every training set, and
learned from a single document in the prompt.

However, the biggest design difference between Vera and Aver is that Vera has
no variable names, using typed slot references. Vera scores higher than Aver on
all five models that ran both, by one to ten points, and higher than or level
with AILANG on all five.

This is the strongest evidence so far that the biggest design gamble in Vera,
the use of typed De Bruijn indexing, is doing real work. It is also the
comparison least affected by saturation, because neither of these languages is
at the benchmark ceiling.

### All three zero-training-data languages

![Vera against Aver and AILANG, five models](assets/fig-ztd.png)

Widening that comparison to all three zero-training data languages.

Vera leads Aver on all five models and [AILANG](https://ailang.sunholo.com/) on
four, tying the fifth. On the five-model average Vera takes 98.2%, AILANG 96.8%
and Aver 92.4%, against Python's 97.0% on the same five; two of the three
zero-training-data languages beat Python outright.

## Overview

VeraBench measures whether LLMs write better code in a language designed for
them. Vera uses typed slot references instead of variable names, mandatory
contracts, and explicit algebraic effects; all features that should make
LLM-generated code more verifiable.

The benchmark covers five difficulty tiers:

| Tier | Focus | What it tests |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Pure arithmetic | Basic syntax, `@T.n` slot references, simple contracts |
| 2 | String & array ops | Built-in function discovery (`domain_verb` naming) |
| 3 | ADTs & match | Data type definition, De Bruijn indices in match arms |
| 4 | Recursion & termination | `decreases` clauses, Z3 verification |
| 5 | Multi-function & effects | IO, State, Exn, effect propagation across functions |

For each problem, we measure:

- **% solved (pass@1)**. The headline. Solved over the problems that can be
 output-graded, where a refusal, a compile failure, a runtime error and a
 wrong answer all count alike as not solved.
- **check@1**. Does the code pass `vera check` on first attempt?
- **verify@1**. Does it pass `vera verify` (Z3 contract verification)?
- **fix@1**. Given the error message, can the model fix it in one turn?
- **run_correct**. Does execution produce the correct output? Measured only
 over attempts that compiled, so it is not comparable across models that
 refuse or fail to compile at different rates. That is why the charts report
 % solved instead.

The same problems are also run in Python, TypeScript, [Aver](https://github.com/jasisz/aver), and [AILANG](https://ailang.sunholo.com/) as baselines. AILANG and Aver are zero-training-data languages, providing additional data points alongside Vera for the language-design-vs-training-data thesis.

> **Cross-language comparison:** For cross-language headline rates, use the T1–T4 aggregate. Tier 5 tests Vera's algebraic effect handlers, which other languages solve with fundamentally different native idioms. See [#50](https://github.com/aallan/vera-bench/issues/50).

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.11+
* Git
* Node.js 22+ *(optional, for TypeScript baselines and generation)*
* [Aver](https://github.com/jasisz/aver) *(optional, for Aver baselines and generation)*
* [AILANG](https://ailang.sunholo.com/) *(optional, for AILANG baselines and generation)*

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aallan/vera-bench.git
cd vera-bench
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[llm]"
```

The `[llm]` extra installs the Anthropic and OpenAI SDKs. Use `pip install -e .` if you only need validation (no model evaluation).

### Install the Vera compiler

The `vera` command must be available on `$PATH`. Install it anywhere into the same environment, either from a local clone,

```bash
pip install -e /path/to/vera          
```

or directly from GitHub.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/aallan/vera.git   
```
Afterwards you should be able to print the Vera version from the terminal,

```bash
vera version   
```

this should return v0.1.8 or later. Vera 0.1.x changed several semantics the
benchmark depends on, so older compilers will fail validation.

## Running the benchmark

`vera-bench validate` checks all 60 problems and every canonical solution; run it first:

```bash
vera-bench validate
```

A single model against the Vera problems (full-spec mode) is one command:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
vera-bench run --model claude-sonnet-5
```

`vera-bench run` writes one JSONL row per problem attempt to `results/`, and has **no resume**, because it unlinks its output file at startup. It's the primitive; you don't drive a full multi-model run with it directly.

### The full sweep

A real run evaluates the whole model matrix (defined once in [`vera_bench/matrix.py`](vera_bench/matrix.py), and read by everything below) across every language target, and the workflow is shaped by the fact that LLM APIs are slow and flaky. Four scripts, used in order:

**1. Gate before you spend.** [`preflight.sh`](scripts/preflight.sh) checks every model id, provider auth, the request parameters each model accepts, and the Vera / Aver / AILANG toolchains, one problem per check. A couple of dollars against a sweep that is hours:

```bash
bash scripts/preflight.sh
```

**2. Run the sweep.** [`run_sweep.sh`](scripts/run_sweep.sh) runs the whole matrix (every model × its targets) in one terminal, provider streams concurrent. It is **idempotent**: it skips any target already on disk and clean and re-runs the rest, so a killed or rate-limited sweep is recovered simply by running it again. The expensive pro tier is opt-in:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... OPENAI_API_KEY=... MOONSHOT_API_KEY=...
SWEEP_INCLUDE_PRO=1 bash scripts/run_sweep.sh
```

Its terminal goes quiet mid-target; it pipes each run through `tee`, and the progress bar blanks when it's not on a real terminal. That's expected, not a hang; watch it with the next tool instead.

**3. Watch the scoreboard.** [`sweep_status.py`](scripts/sweep_status.py) reads the JSONL rows directly (the only reliable live signal) and separates a **transient** failure that should be re-run (rate-limit, timeout, empty content) from a **real result** that should be kept (a refusal, a compile error, a wrong answer):

```bash
SWEEP_INCLUDE_PRO=1 python scripts/sweep_status.py
```

**4. Repair transient failures surgically.** When a target is complete except for a few blips, [`rerun_failed.py`](scripts/rerun_failed.py) re-runs *only those problems* and splices them back, instead of re-running all 60 (drop `--apply` to preview):

```bash
python scripts/rerun_failed.py --model moonshot/kimi-k2.6 --mode full-spec --apply
```

Loop steps 3–4 until the scoreboard reads all-clean. See [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) for the full stage breakdown, env tunables, and the infrastructure-vs-model definition of "clean".

### Re-grading without re-running

Every result row records the path to the code the model actually wrote, under
`results/code/`. When a grading bug is found after a sweep,
[`regrade.py`](scripts/regrade.py) replays that stored code through the
evaluators and rewrites the verdicts, which turns a paid overnight re-run into
a few minutes of local subprocesses:

```bash
python scripts/regrade.py                 # census, changes nothing
python scripts/regrade.py --apply         # rewrite the verdicts
```

It re-grades every row rather than only the ones a fix was expected to help,
because grading only the latter would import every improvement while hiding any
regression the same change caused. Only verdict fields are replaced; token
counts, timings and model identity describe the original run and are carried
through untouched.

### Baselines

Canonical-solution reference runs; no model, no API key, one per comparison language:

```bash
vera-bench baselines                        # python (default)
vera-bench baselines --language typescript
vera-bench baselines --language aver
vera-bench baselines --language ailang
```

### Targeted runs

For iterating on one problem or mode rather than a full sweep:

```bash
vera-bench run --model claude-sonnet-5 --tier 1            # one tier
vera-bench run --model claude-sonnet-5 --problem VB-T1-001 # one problem
vera-bench run --model claude-sonnet-5 --mode spec-from-nl # agent writes its own contracts
vera-bench run --model claude-sonnet-5 --language python   # Python (or typescript/aver/ailang)
vera-bench run --model moonshot/kimi-k2.6 --parallel 10    # concurrent dispatch for slow models
```

Supported providers: [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com) (Claude), [OpenAI](https://openai.com) (GPT), [Kimi](https://platform.kimi.ai) (Moonshot), and [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/). Set the matching key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`, or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`).

The Vera language reference ([SKILL.md](https://veralang.dev/SKILL.md)) is fetched from veralang.dev at run time. Use a local copy (for testing unreleased language features, say) with `--skill-md /path/to/SKILL.md`.

## Report generation

Running `vera-bench report results/` generates `results/summary.md` with a summary table, per-tier breakdowns, and per-problem detail. Each `vera-bench run` writes incremental JSONL results (one line per problem attempt), so a run that stops early is still reportable up to the problem it reached.

The headline chart comes from [`scripts/plot_results.py`](scripts/plot_results.py): **% solved** (pass@1) per model × mode over the gradeable problem set. [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) documents it plus the 16:9 talk-slide renderer.

> **There is no resume.** `vera-bench run` deletes any existing output file for that model × language × mode before it starts, so re-running an interrupted target repeats it from problem 1 rather than topping it up. Filenames carry no timestamp, so the old results are gone. Budget a full re-run for any target that does not finish.

Results files are in `.gitignore`; they are generated artefacts, not checked in.

## Prior art

VeraBench is inspired by:

- [HumanEval](https://github.com/openai/human-eval), 164 Python function completion problems
- [MBPP](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/mbpp), 974 Python problems from natural language
- [DafnyBench](https://github.com/sun-wendy/DafnyBench), 782 Dafny verification annotation problems

DafnyBench demonstrated that tracking verification success rates over time attracts genuine research attention; success rates went from 68% to 96% across model generations in under two years. VeraBench aims to create the same longitudinal story for a language designed from scratch for LLM code generation.
