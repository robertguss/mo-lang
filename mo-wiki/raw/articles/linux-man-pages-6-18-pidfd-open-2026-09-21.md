pidfd_open(2)              System Calls Manual              pidfd_open(2)
```

## NAME top

```

       pidfd_open - obtain a file descriptor that refers to a task

```

## LIBRARY top

```

       Standard C library (libc, -lc)

```

## SYNOPSIS top

```

       #include <sys/syscall.h>      /* Definition of SYS_* constants */
       #include <unistd.h>

       int syscall(SYS_pidfd_open, pid_t pid, unsigned int flags);

       Note: glibc provides no wrapper for pidfd_open(), necessitating
       the use of syscall(2).

```

## DESCRIPTION top

```

       The pidfd_open() system call creates a file descriptor that refers
       to the task referenced by pid.  The file descriptor is returned as
       the function result; the close-on-exec flag is set on the file
       descriptor.

       The flags argument either has the value 0, or contains the
       following flags:

       PIDFD_NONBLOCK (since Linux 5.10)
              Return a nonblocking file descriptor.  If the task referred
              to by the file descriptor has not yet terminated, then an
              attempt to wait on the file descriptor using waitid(2) will
              immediately return the error EAGAIN rather than blocking.

       PIDFD_THREAD (since Linux 6.9)
              Create a file descriptor that refers to a specific thread,
              rather than a process (thread-group leader).  If this flag
              is not set, pid must refer to a process.

```

## RETURN VALUE top

```

       On success, pidfd_open() returns a file descriptor (a nonnegative
       integer).  On error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate
       the error.

```

## ERRORS top

```

       EINVAL flags is not valid.

       EINVAL pid is not valid.

       EMFILE The per-process limit on the number of open file
              descriptors has been reached (see the description of
              RLIMIT_NOFILE in getrlimit(2)).

       ENFILE The system-wide limit on the total number of open files has
              been reached.

       ENODEV The anonymous inode filesystem is not available in this
              kernel.

       ENOMEM Insufficient kernel memory was available.

       ESRCH  The process specified by pid does not exist.

```

## STANDARDS top

```

       Linux.

```

## HISTORY top

```

       Linux 5.3.

```

## NOTES top

```

       The following code sequence can be used to obtain a file
       descriptor for the child of fork(2):

           pid = fork();
           if (pid > 0) {     /* If parent */
               pidfd = pidfd_open(pid, 0);
               ...
           }

       Even if the child has already terminated by the time of the
       pidfd_open() call, its PID will not have been recycled and the
       returned file descriptor will refer to the resulting zombie
       process.  Note, however, that this is guaranteed only if the
       following conditions hold true:

       •  the disposition of SIGCHLD has not been explicitly set to
          SIG_IGN (see sigaction(2));

       •  the SA_NOCLDWAIT flag was not specified while establishing a
          handler for SIGCHLD or while setting the disposition of that
          signal to SIG_DFL (see sigaction(2)); and

       •  the zombie process was not reaped elsewhere in the program
          (e.g., either by an asynchronously executed signal handler or
          by wait(2) or similar in another thread).

       If any of these conditions does not hold, then the child process
       (along with a PID file descriptor that refers to it) should
       instead be created using clone(2) with the CLONE_PIDFD flag.

   Use cases for PID file descriptors
       A PID file descriptor returned by pidfd_open() (or by clone(2)
       with the CLONE_PID flag) can be used for the following purposes:

       •  The pidfd_send_signal(2) system call can be used to send a
          signal to the process referred to by a PID file descriptor.

       •  A PID file descriptor can be monitored using poll(2),
          select(2), and epoll(7).

          When the task that it refers to terminates and becomes a
          zombie, these interfaces indicate the file descriptor as
          readable (EPOLLIN).  When the task is reaped, these interfaces
          produce a hangup event (EPOLLHUP).

          Note, however, that in the current implementation, nothing can
          be read from the file descriptor (read(2) on the file
          descriptor fails with the error EINVAL).  The polling behavior
          depends on whether PIDFD_THREAD flag was used when obtaining
          the file descriptor:

          •  With PIDFD_THREAD, the file descriptor becomes readable when
             the task exits and becomes a zombie, even if the thread-
             group is not empty.

          •  Without PIDFD_THREAD, the file descriptor becomes readable
             only when the last thread in the thread group exits.

       •  If the PID file descriptor refers to a child of the calling
          process, then it can be waited on using waitid(2).

       •  The pidfd_getfd(2) system call can be used to obtain a
          duplicate of a file descriptor of another process referred to
          by a PID file descriptor.

       •  A PID file descriptor can be used as the argument of setns(2)
          in order to move into one or more of the same namespaces as the
          process referred to by the file descriptor.

       •  A PID file descriptor can be used as the argument of
          process_madvise(2) in order to provide advice on the memory
          usage patterns of the process referred to by the file
          descriptor.

       The pidfd_open() system call is the preferred way of obtaining a
       PID file descriptor for an already existing process.  The
       alternative is to obtain a file descriptor by opening a /proc/pid
       directory.  However, the latter technique is possible only if the
       proc(5) filesystem is mounted; furthermore, the file descriptor
       obtained in this way is not pollable and can't be waited on with
       waitid(2).

```

## EXAMPLES top

```

       The program below opens a PID file descriptor for the process
       whose PID is specified as its command-line argument.  It then uses
       poll(2) to monitor the file descriptor for process exit, as
       indicated by an EPOLLIN event.

   Program source

       #define _GNU_SOURCE
       #include <poll.h>
       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <stdlib.h>
       #include <sys/syscall.h>
       #include <sys/types.h>
       #include <unistd.h>

       static int
       pidfd_open(pid_t pid, unsigned int flags)
       {
           return syscall(SYS_pidfd_open, pid, flags);
       }

       int
       main(int argc, char *argv[])
       {
           int            pidfd, ready;
           struct pollfd  pollfd;

           if (argc != 2) {
               fprintf(stderr, "Usage: %s <pid>\n", argv[0]);
               exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
           }

           pidfd = pidfd_open(atoi(argv[1]), 0);
           if (pidfd == -1) {
               perror("pidfd_open");
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           pollfd.fd = pidfd;
           pollfd.events = POLLIN;

           ready = poll(&pollfd, 1, -1);
           if (ready == -1) {
               perror("poll");
               exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
           }

           printf("Events (%#x): POLLIN is %sset\n", pollfd.revents,
                  (pollfd.revents & POLLIN) ? "" : "not ");

           close(pidfd);
           exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
       }
