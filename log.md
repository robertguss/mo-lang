## [2026-09-12] create | Vault initialized
- Domain: the Mo language design (see SCHEMA.md)
- Migrated from two Notion pages in Robert's work workspace, exported verbatim to `raw/notion/design-journal-2026-09-12.md` and `raw/notion/open-questions-2026-09-12.md` with sha256.
- Generated 80 pages: 30 directions, 17 questions, 15 syntax picks + 4 examples + 1 overview, 12 deep dives, 1 plan, 2 sessions. Every page carries frontmatter, a Related list, and auto-links for "direction N" / "QN" / "piece N".
- Conventions adapted from the Hermes `llm-wiki` skill (`.claude/skills/llm-wiki/SKILL.md`): page types swapped to direction / question / decision / syntax-pick / example / deep-dive / plan / session / comparison / concept.
- Tooling: `tools/lint.py`; `qmd` collection `mo-lang` with embeddings.

- Q1–Q10 answered (in). Directions 28–30 added. Q17 added. Q11–Q17 pending.
